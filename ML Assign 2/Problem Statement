2(a) Linear regression: 
Choose 200 random patterns from the
Yacht Hydrodynamics Data Set 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Yacht+Hydrodynamics
for training, remaining for testing.

Apply linear regression (using gradient descent), report training and test errors.

2(b) Perceptron (with  linearly not seperable data; using sum of squared error minimization as discussed in the class):

use the Iris data set at 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris
that belongs to the two classes, viz., Versicolor and Virginica classes (which are known to be not linearly separable). 

Use 70 randomly chosen patterns for training and 30 randomly chosen patterns for testing.
Apply perceptron (linear discriminant, using gradient descent over the criterion that is sum of squared errors (as discussed in the class) ), and report training and test errors.
